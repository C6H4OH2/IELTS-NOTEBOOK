## Write: The Importance of Children's Play

​	The importance of children's play has been lost in recent years <u>for</u> it's regarded as something ==trivial== `(=umimportant)` , or even something negative that ==contrasts with== study. <u>And</u> given that half the people in the world now live in cities, the opportunities for free play are ==curtailed== by perceptions of risk ==to do with== traffic, <u>as well as</u> by parents' increase**d** wish to prevent their children from being victims of crime, <u>and</u> by the emphasis on "earlier is better" / which is leading to greater competitions in academic learning.

​	<u>However</u>, we shouldn't ==lose sight of== play's benefits, and the fundamental contributions / it makes to human achievements in the arts, science and technology. Over two ==millennia== ago, the Greek philosophy Plato has ==extolled== its ==virtues== as ==a means of== developing skills for adult life. A study has  <u>also</u> proved that there is strong *possibility* that play ==underpins== the early development of children's self-control, and giving them the chance to play / will make them more successful problem-solver ==in the long run==. <u>Additionally</u>, playful experience do facilitate children's academic performance. With Lego building before writing, as the latest research shows,  not a single child said that he or she didn't know what to write about any more.

​	<u>Therefore</u>, it's necessary to develop policies / ==concerned with== children's right to play, and to consider the ==implications== for leisure facilities and educational programme. Let's make sure children ==have a rich diet of== play experiences.
